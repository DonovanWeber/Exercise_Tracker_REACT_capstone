### Proposal 
## Donovan Weber
//FINISH README FOR RESUBS AND PLANNING MD 
## Donovan's Exercise/Workout Tracker

## GOAL
To help users keep track of workouts and other metrics within their fitness journey and provide solutions and other examples when a user feels lost on what to do.

## List of minimum features
* Save and track user inputted data and provide short timeline of goals 
* List different workouts a user can complete and section based on body parts
* GPS Tracking for miles and possibly track calories or a system where one can provide a base goal of how much a user may want to lose and provide exercises based off calories in users average diet (for a week)

## Tools, Frameworks, Libraries (update Tech (libraries, dbs ))
* JavaScript
* React
* Redux
* React-Redux
* ExerciseDB API
* Firestore (NoSql)
* Azure (stretch goal to host)

## Goals with time to spare 
* System to figure out a users body type and provide workouts based of different body types (endo, ectomorphs)
* Stylization slick design with interactive exercises and slick tracking ui
* Work on hosting it as a phone app and/or connecting to a bluetooth device that can track location 
* GPS Tracking 
## Tech for stretch 
* React Native
* Google Location API 
* Azure 
* Github Pages
