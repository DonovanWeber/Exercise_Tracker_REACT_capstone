Pierre's Bakery is ran through the terminal where you can type your answers for how many loaves of bread or pastries you would like. It will then give you a price and discount for every third loaf of bread or pastry you order.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Navigate to `https://github.com/DonovanWeber/Pierres-Bakery`
* Click on the green "Code" button and copy the repository URL or click on the copy button
* Open the terminal on your desktop
* Once in the terminal, use it to navigate to your desktop folder
* Once inside your desktop folder, use the command `git clone https://github.com/DonovanWeber/Pierres-Bakery`
* After cloning the project, navigate into it using the command `cd Pierres_Bakery.Solution`
* Then run `cd Pierres_Bakery.Tests` and run `dotnet restore` inside of the testing directory to build out the objects folder
* Then  navigate to the project directory by `cd Pierres_Bakery` and run `dotnet build`
* After you build the application go back into the terminal and run `dotnet run` to start the application inside of the terminal



## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
